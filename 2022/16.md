- What is the most pressure you can release?
aka What ordering of valve opening yields the most pressure?

Notes
---
- opening a valve with flow rate 0 is never optimal.
- it is possible you'd transition out of a non-zero FR valve without
opening it, only to open it later.

Gist

Find the total flow rate for paths through the valve graph.
Then choose the maximum flow path.

Naive
---
Backtrack:
- at each valve, we can open or not open. Then we can recurse on any neighbor.
    - opening cost 1 minute. transitioning costs 1 minute.
    - If we open + transition, (v, opened_valves, t-2)
    - If we just transition,   (v, opened_valves, t-1)
- can memoize. a state is uniquely defined by the current valve, the set of open valves, and the timestamp.
- O(N!) calls?

Alternative
---
- compute distance between all valves.
    - if we use the shortest distance, we prune a lot of possibilities.
- generate paths with points given by a valve and time opened.
- score paths and choose the max score.

Part 2
--- 
- state is now (u, v, opened_valves, time)
